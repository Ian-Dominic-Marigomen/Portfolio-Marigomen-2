<h2 style="border-style:solid;border-color:Tomato;text-align:center;font-family:calibri">Due to the current world health crisis, many Filipino students are compelled to engage in Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) in order to continue with their studies, and the concept of ubiquitous learning (that is, learning anywhere, everywhere, anytime and every time) has been realized sooner than expected for many. As a student engaged in online learning, I would like you to reflect on your current situation as a learner. Write about the challenges you encounter every day, the funny moments you experienced, and personal suggestions as to how the learning process can be improved. You may also take a picture of your study room or take a screenshot of fun moments with your classmates etc.<h2>

<h3 style="text-align:center;font-family:calibri;background:hsl(10, 100%, 80%)">As a student currently undergoing MOOC, my daily challenges would be, slow internet conection, sudden blackouts and constant distractions. The most memorable moments I remember during MOOC was last year, when my Math B class had a Kahoot session and I won and when we had a costume party during our ICT class. I don't really have a massive problem with the learning process currently, so I don't have any suggestions on how to improve.<h3>
